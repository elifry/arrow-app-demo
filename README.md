# Arrow App Exercise

## **Requirements:**

These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted,
it is because we will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Feel
free to be creative with the requirements.

### Create a native iOS app which will have the following 2 screens

1. Profile Page: A user should be able to upload a photo of themselves
and record an audio clip.
2. Dashboard: It should display a grid showing the photos of all the
users of this app. Tapping on a photo should play the audio recording
uploaded by that particular user.

### For the backend:
1. The app should communicate with a backend framework hosted on
the cloud.
2. Userâ€™s data should be stored in a database of your choice.
3. Good to have (but not necessary): Audio and photo data should be
optimized for best performance before storing to an online storage
service (for example AWS S3).
